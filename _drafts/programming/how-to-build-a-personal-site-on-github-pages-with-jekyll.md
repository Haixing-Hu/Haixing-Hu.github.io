[Github](https://github.com/) provides a free page hosting service for all its
users, say, the [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/). User could generate
their site using the predefined templates, or create the site manually.

In addition to supporting regular HTML content, [GitHub
Pages](http://pages.github.com/) support [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a
simple, blog aware static site generator written by Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll
makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy
them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other
advanced templating features.
